NOTE: This folder comes from [the official sparkle repository on GitHub](https://github.com/cryptolu/sparkle). I only kept the implementations of the functions I needed to test. Below is the original README of this folder:

The folder contains the software implementation of the SPARKLE ciphersuite algorithms. 

It includes multiple implementations of
- [SPARKLE permutations](sparkle)
- [Schwaemm AEAD algorithms](schwaemm)
- [Esch hash functions](esch)


The primitives are described in the Sparkle [paper](https://tosc.iacr.org/index.php/ToSC/article/view/8627/8193) appeared in the IACR Transactions on Symmetric Cryptology (ToSC) Special Issue on Designs for the NIST Lightweight Standardisation Process.
